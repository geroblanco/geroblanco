Hello, I'm [Geronimo Blanco](https://www.geronimoblanco.com)!

I am a High School student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence concepts residing in San Jose, California.

Since mid 2020, I've been working non stop on Python projects. I eventually found my interest in Machine Learning during the end of 2020 and since then, I've constantly pursued it. I've worked with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, and C but Python is my favorite.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my Machine Learning and App Development skills: React JS, Swift, Tensorflow, PyTorch.<br />
